## Overview
A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various programming and real-world applications, such as function calls, expression evaluation, and more.

## Key Concepts

### Basic Operations
1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
5. **isFull**: Check if the stack is full (in case of a fixed-size stack).

### How it Works
- **Push Operation**: When an element is pushed onto the stack, it becomes the new top.
- **Pop Operation**: When the top element is popped from the stack, the next element becomes the new top.
- **LIFO Principle**: The last element that was pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.
